## Lightstreamer - Stock-List Demos - Flash Clients

This project contains two examples of Flash application that employs the <b>Flash/Flex JavaScript Bridge</b>.

Any Flash application can be fed with real-time data delivered by Lightstreamer Server. The integration strategy used is based on a JavaScript/ActionScript bridge. The standard <b>Lightstreamer JavaScript Client Library</b> is used to implement a page that will contain the Flash application and feed it through a LightstreamerClient object. <br>
The library includes a bridge module. The `lsjavascriptbridge.as` library is added to the Flash movie.

The following diagram shows the data flow from Lightstreamer
Server to the Flash application:

```text
 ------          -------------------------------------------------

### Details

<!-- START DESCRIPTION lightstreamer-example-stocklist-client-flash-basic-stock-list-demo---flash-client -->

This very simple demo uses the Flash Bridge to inject real-time data into two Flash movies hosted on the page. Each of the two movies subscribes to two items of the [Stock-List Demos](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-javascript). The smaller movie sets a maximum update frequency of 1 event/sec.

The Flash app uses the <b>ActionScript/JavaScript Bridge</b> provided as part of the "sdk_client_flash". That means the ActionScript API, used within the Flash application, talks to external JavaScript code, in the form of the [FlashBridge](http://www.lightstreamer.com/docs/client_javascript_uni_api/FlashBridge.html) class, that in turn uses a [LightstreamerClient](http://www.lightstreamer.com/docs/client_javascript_uni_api/LightstreamerClient.html) instance to handle the communications with Lightstreamer Server.

The demo includes the following client-side functionalities:
* A [FlashTable](http://www.lightstreamer.com/docs/client_flash_jsdoc/FlashTable.html) containing 2 items, subscribed to in <b>MERGE</b> mode, for each Flash movie.

This is a Flash version of the [Lightstreamer - Basic Stock-List Demo - HTML Client](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-javascript#basic-stock-list-demo---html-client), which displays eight stock quotes with some nice graphic effects.

## Install

If you want to install a version of these demos pointing to your local Lightstreamer Server, follow these steps:

* Note that, as prerequisite, the [Lightstreamer - Stock- List Demo - Java Adapter](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Stocklist-adapter-java) has to be deployed on your local Lightstreamer Server instance. Please check out that project and follow the installation instructions provided with it.
* Launch Lightstreamer Server.
* Download the `deploy.zip` file that you can find in the [deploy release](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-StockList-client-flash/releases) of this project and extract the `Flash_StockListDemo_Basic` and/or `Flash_StockListDemo` folder.
* Crate the folders `/pages/demos/[demo_name]` into your Lightstreamer server installation then copy here the contents of the `Flash_StockListDemo_Basic` or `Flash_StockListDemo` folder.
* Get the `lightstreamer.js` file from the [latest Lightstreamer distribution](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download) in the `/DOCS-SDKs/sdk_client_javascript/lib` folder and put it in the `/[demo_name]/js` folder of the demo.
* Get the `require.js` file form [requirejs.org](http://requirejs.org/docs/download.html) and put it in the `/[demo_name]/js` folder of the demo.
* Get the `swfobject.js` version 2.2 file form [SWFObject 2](http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/downloads/list) and put it in the `/[demo_name]/js` folder of the demo.
* Launch the demo.

## Build

To build your own version of the Flash movies, instead of using the one provided in the `deploy.zip` file from the Install section above, the `src/[demo_name]/flash` directories contain the sources to build from a Flash IDE.<br>
Before you can build the demos you need to get the <b>ActionScript/JavaScript Bridge</b> provided as part of the "sdk_client_flash", get the `lsjavascriptbridge.as` file from the [latest Lightstreamer distribution](http://www.lightstreamer.com/download) in the `/DOCS-SDKs/sdk_client_flash/lib` folder.<br>
Please once obtained the movies (`test_movie.swf`, `test_movie2.swf` and `demoFlashSmall.swf`) copy them to the `/js` folders of their respective demo. 

You can deploy these demos in order to use the Lightstreamer server as Web server or in any external Web Server you are running. 
If you choose the former case please note that in the `<LS_HOME>/pages/demos/` folder there is a copy of the `src/[demo_name]` directories of this project, in other cases please create the folders `<LS_HOME>/pages/demos/[demo_name]` then copy here the contents of the `src/[demo_name]` folder of this project.<br>
The client demos configuration assumes that Lightstreamer Server, Lightstreamer Adapters and this client are launched on the same machine. If you need to targeting a different Lightstreamer server please search this line:
```js
var lsClient = new LightstreamerClient(protocolToUse+"//localhost:8080","DEMO");
```
in `lsClient.js` or `index.html`, depending on the demo, and change it accordingly.<br>
Anyway the [QUOTE_ADAPTER](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-Stocklist-adapter-java) and [LiteralBasedProvider](https://github.com/Weswit/Lightstreamer-example-ReusableMetadata-adapter-java) have to be deployed in your local Lightstreamer server instance. The factory configuration of Lightstreamer server already provides this adapter deployed.<br>
The demos are now ready to be launched.
